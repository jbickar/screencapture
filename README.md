screencapture
=============

Bash script for making a ton of screengrabs

Mac OS X only.

To use:

1. Disable automatic screensaver
2. Enter "about:config" in the address bar for Firefox
3. Enter browser.link.open_newwindow.override.external in the filter
4. Set the value for that setting to "-1" (this will stop Firefox from opening external links in a new tab)
5. Populate sites-list.txt with as many URLs as you wish to screengrab
6. Run screencapture.sh
